# A genetic algorithm in Julia

I am using a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of binary strings to match a target string.

This example demonstrates a genetic algorithm in Julia to evolve a population of binary strings to match a target string.

The algorithm involves selection, crossover, and mutation steps to improve the fitness of individuals in the population over generations. 

Note that this was a simplified example, and a more complex one can be customizable based on the problem you're trying to solve.
